# Python-Projects
This is a place where I will put my games and codes and projects that I make with python. It will start off as pretty basic but then it will soon become advanced and way better!
The one above this is a guessing game that I made! If there is any bugs let me now.
The game is basically where you are supposed to pick a level between 1-3 and it gives you a description of what each level is. Then you have to guess a number between whatever level you chose. Then you have after each number that you guess it will tell you if the number you guessed is greather than or less than or is the number that the computer generated.
