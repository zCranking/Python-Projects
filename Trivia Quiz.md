# Python-Projects
This is a place where I will put my games and codes and projects that I make with python. It will start off as pretty basic but then it will soon become advanced and way better!
The Trivia Quiz is a quiz that I made where you answer questions about random topics. For example, one question is about gaming and then the next question is about Henry Ford. There is ten questions in total. I will make a new and improved version that is way better. If there is any bugs please let me know!
